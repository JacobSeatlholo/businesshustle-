# Learning fundementals 

Do you find yourself out of budget for branding?. This could possibly mean that it is time to get your leadership to be vocal on social media as a non-negotiable. 

Weather you are using Google Ads, Tiktok, Facebook, YouTube... It doesn't matter.

There are only 2 ways to turn a non profitable campaign into an effective profitable one:

**1. Reduce your cost per conversion**

or 

**2. Increase your revenue per conversion** 

Let's dig in:

## How to reduce your cost per conversion:

Increase CTR  by lowering CPCs (w/ CPM model)
- Lower manual bids
- Test bid models: CPC vs target CPA, lowest cost conversion etc.
- Increase CVR
- Block placements, demographics, time of day

## How to increase your revenue per conversion:

- Increase conversion rate
- Increase LTV (revenue per sale or sales per customer)
- Increase referrals (1 paid user => 1.x total users where x > 0)
- Increase virality (ex: paid Twitter ads retweeted = free impressions)

## 3 ways to increase your conversion rate

**1. Target higher intent users**

This is self-explanatory:

* Keywords / negative keywords
* Audiences, demographics, interests
* Placements, devices etc.

**2. Simply improve your ads to increase appeal.**

The right appeal (value prop) makes or breaks any campaign. 

**3. Improve your landing page**

1/ Explain the value you provide (title)
2/ Explain how you'll create it (subtitle)
3/ Let the user visualise it (visual)
4/ Make it believable (social proof)
5/ Make taking the next step easy (CTA)
